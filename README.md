# Create CEN APP

This is a cen-stack project bootstrapped with [create-cen-app](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-cen-app).

## Start your app

navigate to your frontend folder and run:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

#### if you are running an external Backend (like FastAPI), you will need to start that as well. Navigate to your backend folder and run:

```bash
./run
```

<h2 id="about">The Client Engineering Stack</h2>

The stack is focused on **simplicity**, **modularity**, and **speed**. It consists of:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com)
- [carbon design system](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com)
- [TypeScript](https://typescriptlang.org)
- [tRPC](https://trpc.io) or [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com)

## Why this stack?

- **Next.js** is a great produciton ready React framework. It's got a great community, great docs, and is very easy to use.
- **Tailwind CSS** is a utility-first CSS framework that is easy to learn and use. It's also very customizable and has a great community.
- **FastAPI** is a great Backend-choice when working with Data Scientists, as their code be easily pasted into the backend. It's easy to use, has great docs, and the automatic implementation of the **Swagger UI** makes it great to work with.
- **tRPC** when Data Science is not a major requirement, tRPC is a great choice for a Backend-solution (technically Next.js is the backend). It provides type-safety from back- to frontend and has an overall great developer experience.
