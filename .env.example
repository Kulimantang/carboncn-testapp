# Since the ".env" file is gitignored, you can use the ".env.example" file to
# build a new ".env" file when you clone the repo. Keep this file up-to-date
# when you add new variables to `.env`.

# This file will be committed to version control, so make sure not to have any
# secrets in it. If you are cloning this repo, create a copy of this file named
# ".env" and populate it with your secrets.

# When adding additional environment variables, the schema in "/src/env.mjs"
# should be updated accordingly.

# Example:
# SERVERVAR="foo"
# NEXT_PUBLIC_CLIENTVAR="bar" (Client env vars must start with NEXT_PUBLIC_)
# keep in mind that NEXT_PUBLIC_ vars have to be available at build time
# to use runtime env vars pass them to the client via getServerSideProps

# You need this in your .env when using Recoil with next.js
RECOIL_DUPLICATE_ATOM_KEY_CHECKING_ENABLED=false

# use this when running the backend locally
